# 1. Given a text file. You need to create a new file to rewrite all the words consisting of at least seven letters from the first file.
# 2. Given a text file. Count the number of words in it.
# 3. Create a program that checks the text for invalid words.
# If an invalid word is found, it should be replaced with a set of characters *.
# Based on the results of the program, you need to show the statistics of actions.
# We have text:
# To be, or not to be, that is the question,
# Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
# Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
# No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
# That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep
